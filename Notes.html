1-   <form action="https://www.google.com/search">
            <input type="text" name="q">
            <input type="submit" value="Google Search">
     </form>

the action parameter specifies where to send the form data when submitted
the q name for the input text converts the input to a GET parameter to be included in the URL

same thing can be done for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?q=Harvard
https://www.google.com/search?q=Harvard
and you can check out anything else by yourself

notice that q stands for a "query" which means a search






2- Display types : inline - block - inline-block - none - flex

inline display is the default diplay for -> anchor tags , img tags , span tags , and more
objects are displayed on same line next to eachother
horizontal (left-right) margins respsected

block display is the default display for -> heading tags , paragraph tags , div tags
objects are displayed under eachother 
all margins respected

inline-block
objects are displayed inline , but allows some block featues

none
objects are hidden (useful later in jQuery)

flex
allows wrapping around




3- Position types:

static position is the default position for everything 
it follows the workflow of your code , so what comes first is drawn first

relative position is exactly like static 
but with adding the ability to adjust left,right,top,bottom 
"left:10px"
but left,right,top,bottom are not really used here because they're not very efficient

absolute position is when you want to absolutely set a certain position for an object
that object would not move even if any thing happens around it
** absolutely set object are relative to something tho , if they do not have a relatively
   positioned parent , they will be relative to the main window "Like GUI" **
that's why a relative(anything but static) parent and absolute children go along nicely

fixed positions STAY on screen even when you scroll down
they're used in ads in pages for example

sticky position is a mix of absolute and fixed
it behaves like absolute , but when you scroll out of range it get stuck to the top of your page





4- Making a clickable image
   put an img inside an anchor tag

   <a href="google.com">
      <img src="google_logo.png" alt="Google logo">
   </a>
